# Publish a package 
In this quick run through, we will see how you can simply publish a package into your `Nplfared` registry.
This will allow you easily share private package for your project and share them with your team ü§ù.

## Create a package
Let's create a simple package that will be published into our registry.

<PackageManagerTabs command="init" />

Let's add some code to our package

```js title="index.js"

export const add = (a, b) => a + b;

export const sub = (a, b) => a - b;

export const mul = (a, b) => a * b;

export const div = (a, b) => a / b;
```

Now we need to update our `package.json` file

```json {6-9} title="package.json"
{
  "name": "@acme/math",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public",
    "registry": "http://your-npflared-registry.dev"
  },
  "exports": {
    ".": "./index.js"
  },
}
```
You need to add a `publishConfig` property to our `package.json` file. 
This property will allow us to specify the registry where we want to publish our package.
You will need to replace `http://your-npflared-registry.dev` with your own registry url.

## Generate a token 
> If you already have a token with dedicated permission you can skip this section

Check [this](/guide/api/tokens) in order to generate a new token

## Setup you registry access
In order to authenticate to your registry you will need to add a `.npmrc` file with the following content

```txt file=".npmrc"
//your-npflared-registry.dev/:_authToken=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

## Hit the publish button üöÄ

<PackageManagerTabs command="publish" />


You can now download, upgrade and consume your package üî•

## Installing your package

First make to have setup an `.npmrc` file with a token having the right accesses.

Then you can run the following command:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install --registry http://your-npflared-registry.dev" />

--- 

If you are using scoped package eg `@acme/math` you can add the following to your `.npmrc` file
```txt file=".npmrc"
@acme:registry=http://your-npflared-registry.dev
```
In order to automatically resolve your scoped package with your private registry.

### Personal note
For example I have multiple package in my private registry scoped with `@thomascogez` like (`@thomascogez/common`, `@thomascogez/tsconfig` `@thomascogez/biome-config`, ...)
That I use in my projects. 

In every project want to use them i add the following to my `.npmrc` file
```txt file=".npmrc"
@thomascogez:registry=http://your-npflared-registry.dev
//your-npflared-registry.dev/:_authToken=${NPFLARED_AUTH_TOKEN} # <- NPFLARED_AUTH_TOKEN is stored on my machine env
```

## Publish a new version of your package 

If you make change to your package, you will need to publish a new version. 
This is really easy, you will need to bump the package version in your `package.json` file and then hit the publish button again !
